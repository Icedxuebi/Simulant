## Instructions

The project is still in an early development stage. Errors, crashes, and similar issues are to be expected.

A complete validation flow is not yet in place, so please follow the steps below strictly.

> [!TIP]
> **When downloading, get the latest released `dll` from the Release section on the right. Do not download the source code from the top of the page.**

- The plugin currently depends on the following ACT plugins:

  - FFXIV Parsing Plugin
  - [OverlayPlugin](https://github.com/OverlayPlugin/OverlayPlugin)
  - [Triggernometry](https://github.com/MnFeN/Triggernometry) (v2.0 or above)
  - [PostNamazu](https://github.com/Natsukage/PostNamazu)

  The first two come bundled with any all-in-one ACT distribution. Installation instructions for the latter two can be found at [this link](https://www.bilibili.com/opus/998425290402168834).

  If you have already installed my Triggernometry bundle, you can skip this step.

- Load this plugin's `dll` into ACT's plugin list to complete the setup. It can be placed fairly far down the list.

- After the plugin is loaded and while the game is running, click "Initialize Plugin".

> [!WARNING]
> This plugin has compatibility issues with some Dalamud plugins.
>
> If you encounter a game crash or an initialization error (such as a certain Ptr not being found during scanning), try a clean launch, or run only the Dalamud framework.

- Once initialization is complete, enter any inn map and check "Enable Firewall". This feature is similar to the Dalamud plugin [Hyperborea](https://github.com/kawaii/Hyperborea).

  This intercepts all incoming and outgoing packets except heartbeat packets, putting you into local mode.

  For now, do not interact with scene entities (such as the inn door) while in this mode, otherwise you will get stuck.

- Select a map on the left, or enter a map ID. If the map has phases/simulations available, you can pick one from the dropdown list.

  To filter for the currently implemented demos, check "Show only maps with preset areas" in the map selection window.

- Click "Load Area". After the map finishes loading, click "Start Simulation" in the preset panel on the right. Wait until each simulation has fully finished before clicking "Stop Simulation" (interrupt-style termination is not yet implemented).

- When you are done, uncheck "Enable Firewall" to return to your original location in the inn.

- If any step during this process causes the game to crash, please record the issue and restart ACT.

- Optional: If you experience problems with text or UI layout, you can install a font:

  [Sarasa Gothic](https://github.com/be5invis/Sarasa-Gothic/releases)

  Download the Mono archive from the Single Family TTF Package and install the font.
